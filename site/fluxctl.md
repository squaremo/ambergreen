title: fluxctl command-line interface
---

`fluxctl` is the command-line interface to Weave Flux. It has
subcommands for defining services, selecting containers to be
instances of a service, and querying the state of the system.

Synopsis:

```
Usage:
  fluxctl [command]

Available Commands:
  service     define a service
  list        list the services defined
  info        display info on all services
  query       display instances selected by the given filter
  rm          remove service definition(s)
  select      include containers in a service
  deselect    remove a container selection rule from a service
  version     print version and exit

Flags:
  -h, --help[=false]: help for fluxctl
```

### See system state

The most useful command, at least to start with, is `fluxctl
info`. This tells you what is known about the system, including the
configuration of the services, and instances that have been added to
the services.

```
Usage:
  fluxctl info [flags]

Flags:
  -s, --service="": display only this service
```

The output looks like this:

```
HOSTS
192.168.3.165

SERVICES
hello
  Address: 10.128.0.1:80
  Protocol: http
  RULES
    default {"image":"tutum/hello-world"}
  INSTANCES
    968a80583167b510a4915e0397d86563027507ec0803581965825c214d0d3034 192.168.3.165:32769 live
    6c222af1f1fc392319f94cca299ac53e49dff82cbf835653aef951fae48adb70 192.168.3.165:32770 live
    4419e651cc298f40463294b4aad9e23c5b530607dc3f9e164718a9f93ebe8a26 192.168.3.165:32768 live
```

At the top there is a list of hosts known to tbe running fluxd.

After the hosts are the details of each services. Here there is a
single service with the name `hello`.  It is accessed using http on
port 80 of the floating IP address 10.128.0.1.  Under that that are
the selection rules (this one indicates that containers using the
image `"tutum/hello-world"` should be selected for the `hello`
service). Last, for each service, is a list of instances, each with
its address and state.

`live` here means the instance is on-line. Other states may indicate
problems with the instance; for example `no address` means the
container matched the selection rules, but an address could not be
determined for it (probably because it didn't have a published port).

### Define and remove services

`fluxctl service` is the subcommand to define a service. It needs a
name, and usually you'll supply the address on which the service
should listen.

You can specify the protocol for the service -- whether it should be
treated as HTTP or plain TCP -- with the option `--protocol`. (Using
HTTP means you get extra, HTTP-specific metrics.)

It's possible to create a service that has no address. You might do
this if you were going to use it only to control an external load
balancer (like [the edgebal image](edgebal)). If so, you may want to
supply an `--instance-port` value, since you won't be implying one in
a service address. Otherwise, instances won't be addressable (and
therefore won't be used) until you supply a port.

There are also options for selecting containers to be instances, as a
shortcut to using a subsequent `fluxctl select ...` command.

```
Usage:
  fluxctl service <name> [flags]

Flags:
      --address="": in the format <ipaddr>:<port>, the IP address and port at which the service should be made available on each host.
      --env="": select only containers with these environment variable values, given as comma-delimited key=value pairs
      --image="": select only containers with this image
      --labels="": select only containers with these labels, given as comma-delimited key=value pairs
      --instance-port=0: use this port for instance addresses, either in the absence of, or overriding the service address.
  -p, --protocol="": the protocol to assume for connections to the service; either "http" or "tcp".
      --tag="": select only containers with this tag
```

You can remove a service, or all services, with `fluxctl rm`:

```
Usage:
  fluxctl rm <service>|--all
```

### Select and deselect instances

Once you have a service defined, you can select containers to be
enrolled as instances of the service. Weave Flux will load-balance
connections to the *service address* amongst the *instance addresses*.

Selecting containers is done by giving a rule for matching properties
of a given container; the container is enrolled if _all_ the
properties match. For example, if the rule is
`image=foo-api,tag=v0.3`, then a container must have both the image
`foo-api` and the tag `v0.3` to be included.

In general the rules match labels (`--labels`) and environment entries
(`--env`) of the container. The special labels `image` and `tag` match
the image name and image tag respectively (`foo-api` and `v0.3` of the
image `foo-api:v0.3`). These have their own options `--image` and
`--tag`.

A service may have several rules, e.g., from more than one invocation
of `fluxctl select`; a container will be enrolled if it matches _any_
of the rules. To repeat: matching _any_ rule will do, but _each_part_
of the rule must match.

```
Usage:
  fluxctl select <service> <rule> [flags]

Flags:
      --env="": select only containers with these environment variable values, given as comma-delimited key=value pairs
      --image="": select only containers with this image
      --labels="": select only containers with these labels, given as comma-delimited key=value pairs
      --tag="": select only containers with this tag
```

When you use `fluxctl select ...`, you give the rule a name. The name
can be used to remove that rule later. A container that matched the
removed rule may remain as an instance, if it matches another rule.

```
Usage:
  fluxctl deselect <service> <rule>
```

### List services and query instances

You can list the currently configured services, and optionally their
selection rules, using `fluxctl list`.

```
Usage:
  fluxctl list [flags]

Flags:
  -f, --format="": format each service with the go template expression given
      --format-rule="": format each rule with the go template expression given (implies --verbose)
  -v, --verbose[=false]: show the details of each service
```

You can also query for instances, of a particular service or of any
service, using `fluxctl query`.

This subcommand accepts the same label-matching flags as select, and
will display only the instances that match.

```
Usage:
  fluxctl query [flags]

Flags:
      --env="": select only containers with these environment variable values, given as comma-delimited key=value pairs
  -f, --format="": format each instance according to the go template given (overrides --quiet)
      --image="": select only containers with this image
      --labels="": select only containers with these labels, given as comma-delimited key=value pairs
  -q, --quiet[=false]: print only instance names, one to a line
  -s, --service="": print only instances in <service>
      --tag="": select only containers with this tag
```

By default, `fluxctl query` will print a table of matching
instances. You can tell it to show just the instance names with
`--quiet`; or, you can supply a template expression to format the
instance data on each line; for example,

```
fluxctl query --format {% raw %}'{{json .}}'{% endraw %}
```
